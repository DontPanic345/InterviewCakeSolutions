# Reverse a linked list

https://www.interviewcake.com/question/python/reverse-linked-list

I am using https://rustbyexample.com/custom_types/enum/testcase_linked_list.html as a starting point

Okay so what I implimented was 'out of place', this was the bonus task from the challenge, but using
Rust it came to me as the natual solution. http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/first-push.html
Explains everything about linked lists in Rust, hopefully I'll get time to read it some day.
